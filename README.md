<h1 align="center">Bowling app</h1>

## About bowling app
Bowling app is a game that reads a file with the player's pinfalls and calculates the total score for it. When the player hits a strike it sums the next two points to the total. When the player hits a spare it sums the next point to the total. The player is allowed to play 10 frames with 2 chances per frame.
Built with Ruby and tested with RSpec. The output was formatted using terminal-table and rainbow gem packages.

## About the project
The game has a basic interface that runs in the terminal.

The goals of this project are:

- Practice with OOP (Object Oriented Programming) using Ruby.
- Learn how to create and structure a Ruby project.
- Learn to manage the files with correct usage to make code maintainable.
- Practice Git Flow and Github Flow creating branches for different features and for version control.

## Setup

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Prerequisites
Computer running Mac OS, Windows, or Linux Ubuntu.

Have Ruby installed. You can see this link for more detailed instructions [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
