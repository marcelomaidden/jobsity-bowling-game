## about bowling game
Bowling app is a game that reads a file with the player's pinfalls and calculates the total score for it. When the player hits a strike it sums the next two points to the total. When the player hits a spare it sums the next point to the total.
Built with Ruby and tested with RSpec. The output was formatted using terminal-table gem package.
